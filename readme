Greetings!

I have built an authentication application using the popular backend frameworks,
Express, and a robust NoSQL database, MongoDB. This application uses secure authentication protocols and methods to ensure user privacy and security.
By utilizing these technologies, I have created a modern, efficient, and reliable authentication system that can be integrated into any web-based application with ease.

I included:

* Login with e-mail verification
* Signup with email and OTP verification
* Reset password with authenitcation
* Token Verification

I used ...

- Nodemailer (To sent email)
- Passport API (not yet)
- JWT for token authentication
